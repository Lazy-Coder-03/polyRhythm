# Music Arc Visualization

This is a JavaScript sketch that creates a visual representation of music using arcs. It's built using the p5.js library. Each arc corresponds to a different note, and the arcs animate to the beat of the music, creating an interesting visual effect.

## Getting Started

You can run this sketch by following these simple steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The sketch should start running, and you will see a visual representation of music in the form of animated arcs.

## Prerequisites

You will need a web browser to run this sketch.

## Usage

Once you open the sketch in your web browser, you can interact with it as follows:

- **Click to Play**: Click anywhere in the sketch to toggle sound on/off. When sound is enabled, the arcs will move and play notes corresponding to their positions.

## Customization

You can customize the sketch by modifying the following variables in the code:

- `lineWidth`: Adjust the line width for the arcs.
- `animationSpeed`: Change the animation speed of the arcs.
- `sound`: Replace the sound files in the `assets` folder with your own audio files.
